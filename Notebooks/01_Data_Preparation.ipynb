    "\n",
    "#### How did we prepare the data for analysis?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into calculations and visualizations, it was essential to clean and structure the raw financial data for smooth processing. Here’s how we approached it:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Transposing DataFrames (`.T`)  \n",
    "After inspecting the extracted DataFrames (`income_statement_df`, `balance_sheet_df`, `cash_flow_df`), we noticed that **metrics** were organized as rows and **years** as columns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare the data for time-series analysis and ratio calculations, we transposed each DataFrame using `.T`. This step flipped the structure so that **years became the index** and **metrics became the columns**—a format that’s ideal for observing trends and performing column-wise computations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Converting Index to Datetime & Sorting  \n",
    "The index (which now held year-end dates such as `'2024-12-31'`) was converted from strings to proper datetime objects using `pd.to_datetime()`. This enabled us to leverage Pandas’ powerful time-series functionalities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We then sorted each DataFrame chronologically with `sort_index(ascending=True)` to ensure all subsequent analyses and visualizations reflected the correct temporal order.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Handling Missing Values (`NaN`)  \n",
    "In some metrics, missing values (`NaN`) indicated **no reported data** for that year. To address this, we replaced these entries with `0` using `fillna(0)`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While **2020** had partial records in some statements, the data was too sparse for meaningful ratio calculations or trend analysis. We therefore excluded 2020 to ensure our insights are based on consistent and complete information.\n",
    "Our analysis focuses primarily on **2021 onwards**, where data quality and consistency are much higher.  "

    "### 📊 **4. Preparing Financial Data for Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How did we prepare the dataset for ratio calculations?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into financial ratio analysis, it was important to focus on the most relevant metrics and align them into a single, consolidated dataset. Here’s how we approached it:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Selecting Relevant Metrics  \n",
    "We started by narrowing down our dataset to include only the financial metrics required for ratio analysis:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- From the transposed income statement (`income_statement_transposed`), we extracted key metrics and stored them in a DataFrame called `selected_income`.  \n",
    "- Similarly, from the transposed balance sheet (`balance_sheet_transposed`) & (`cash_flow_transposed`), we selected essential metrics and saved them in `selected_balance` & `selected_cashflow` respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensured that we were working with a **focused dataset**, keeping only the information necessary for our analysis.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### 2. Merging DataFrames  \n",
    "Next, we merged the `selected_income`, `selected_balance`, and `selected_cashflow` DataFrames into a single consolidated DataFrame named `financial_data`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The merges were performed sequentially on their **date indices (years)** using `left_index=True` and `right_index=True`, ensuring all metrics aligned correctly across years.  \n",
    "- This resulted in a clean, unified dataset containing all selected metrics from the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement for each financial year.  \n",
    "- Additionally, we initialized a new DataFrame `df` with the same date index to store the calculated financial ratios."

    "After preprocessing and preparing the data, the next step was to calculate key financial ratios to extract deeper insights into the company’s performance. These ratios are crucial indicators of profitability, liquidity, solvency, and operational efficiency, helping assess the overall financial health of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to the following questions:  \n",
    "- How profitable is the company in relation to its revenue and investments?  \n",
    "- Can the company meet its short-term obligations effectively?  \n",
    "- What does the company’s capital structure reveal about its reliance on debt?  \n",
    "- How efficiently is the company utilizing its assets to generate revenue?  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Ratio Categories :-\n",
    "- **Profitability Ratios**: Gross Profit Margin, Net Profit Margin, Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) measuring the company's profit generation relative to revenue and investments.\n",
    "- **Liquidity Ratios**: Current Ratio, which reflects the company’s ability to meet short-term obligations.  \n",
    "- **Solvency Ratios**: Debt-to-Equity Ratio, indicating the firm’s reliance on debt versus equity financing.  \n",
    "- **Efficiency Ratios**: Asset Turnover Ratio, highlighting how efficiently assets are being utilized to drive revenue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While computing these ratios, care was taken to handle division-by-zero scenarios. Any such instances were replaced with `NaN` values using:  \n",
    "`.replace([float('inf'), -float('inf')], pd.NA)`  ensuring that such instances result in NaN or pd.NA rather than errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, profitability and return ratios (e.g., Gross Profit Margin, Net Profit Margin, ROA, ROE, ROIC) were converted into percentages for better interpretability, in line with financial reporting conventions. Ratios such as Current Ratio, Debt-to-Equity, and Asset Turnover were retained as multipliers or decimals, reflecting standard industry practices."
