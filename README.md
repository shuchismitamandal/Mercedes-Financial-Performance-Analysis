## **üìò Project Overview**

This project combines my passion for the automotive industry, specifically **Mercedes-Benz**, with my interest in finance and data analysis. Financial statements can often be complex and difficult to interpret, making it challenging to extract meaningful insights.In this notebook, we perform a comprehensive **financial statement analysis** of **Mercedes-Benz Group** covering the period from **2020 to 2024**. The data was sourced using the `yfinance` API, which allows seamless access to financial statements and stock market data.

Our goal is to uncover key **trends**, identify **performance drivers**, and derive **actionable insights** that can inform strategies for growth and improved profitability.

## ‚ùì Questions Answered

- Is the company making more profit now than it did in the past?
- Is the company getting better or worse at managing its money, paying off what it owes, and running efficiently?
- Are investors likely to get good returns based on how the company is using its money and assets?
- Where does the company get most of its cash from, and how is it spending that money?
- Is the company relying more on loans or its own money to fund its activities?
- As the company earns more, is it also keeping more of that money as profit?

### ü§ì About `yfinance`

We used the **`yfinance`** Python library to retrieve financial data for Mercedes-Benz Group AG (`MBG.DE`) from Yahoo Finance. This allowed us to:

Using `yfinance` eliminated the need for manual downloads and streamlined the analysis process.
